# MeikiKai

MeikiKai is a macOS Japanese OCR popup dictionary. It watches a selected screen, reads visible Japanese text with OCR, and shows dictionary entries when you hover text.

This project is a fork of [rtr46/meikipop](https://github.com/rtr46/meikipop). Thank you to rtr46 and the MeikiPop contributors for the original app, dictionary pipeline, OCR architecture, and overall reading workflow this fork builds on.

## What changed in this fork

MeikiKai renames the app, Python package, CLI, support files, and build artifacts around the new name, while narrowing the app experience around macOS:

- Renamed the desktop app, package, and command to **MeikiKai** / `meikikai`.
- macOS-only runtime, packaging, paths, permissions, and input handling.
- Removed Windows, Linux, Wayland, Flatpak, Magpie, and Chrome Screen AI support.
- Added separate app and menu bar icons, including an inactive icon when paused.
- Moved the enable/pause toggle into the menu bar menu as the first item.
- Added optional media auto-pause while the popup is open.

## Features

- **Screen-wide lookup:** works with games, manga, videos, PDFs, websites, and other apps because it reads pixels from the selected screen.
- **Display selection:** OCR a full display or all displays.
- **Always-on auto scan:** keeps OCR results warm in the background for responsive hover lookups.
- **Hover popup:** dictionary entries appear next to the cursor in a compact bundled-data layout, with configurable positioning including a visual-novel-friendly mode.
- **Local OCR:** uses fast local `meikiocr` for Japanese text recognition.
- **JMdict/KANJIDIC dictionary:** includes word lookup, deconjugation, frequency ranking, kanji entries, components, and examples.
- **Yomitan imports:** replace the bundled dictionary with one or more Yomitan/Yomichan dictionaries.
- **Bundled dictionary details:** word lookup, deconjugation, frequency ranking, POS/tags, glosses, kanji readings, examples, and components are shown without popup content toggles.

## Requirements

- macOS
- Python 3.10 or newer if running from source
- macOS permissions for the app or terminal you use to run it:
  - **Screen Recording**
  - **Accessibility**
  - **Input Monitoring**

MeikiKai stores user data in:

- `~/Library/Application Support/meikikai/config.ini`
- `~/Library/Application Support/meikikai/dictionary.pkl`
- `~/Library/Caches/meikikai/`

## Install

### macOS app bundle

Download the latest release from this fork:

- <https://github.com/hectahertz/meikipop/releases/latest>

Unpack it, start `MeikiKai.app`, then grant the macOS permissions listed above when prompted or from System Settings.

### Development setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hectahertz/meikipop.git meikikai
cd meikikai
python -m pip install -e .
meikikai
```

## Usage

1. Start MeikiKai with `MeikiKai.app` or `meikikai`.
2. Move the mouse over Japanese text on the selected screen.
3. Right-click the menu bar icon to enable/pause MeikiKai, open settings, choose scan screen, or quit.

## OCR

MeikiKai uses local `meikiocr` for Japanese text recognition. It is optimized for Japanese game text, and the `meikiocr` package handles its models.

## Dictionary commands

MeikiKai downloads the default dictionary on first run if `dictionary.pkl` is missing. To rebuild it from source data:

```bash
meikikai build-dict
```

To replace it with Yomitan/Yomichan dictionaries:

```bash
# Preserve supported structured HTML formatting
meikikai import-yomitan-dict-html dict.zip

# Import compact plain-text definitions
meikikai import-yomitan-dict-text dict.zip

# Merge multiple dictionaries into one dictionary.pkl
meikikai import-yomitan-dict-text dict1.zip dict2.zip
```

Imports overwrite `~/Library/Application Support/meikikai/dictionary.pkl`.

## Settings

Open settings from the menu bar icon. Useful options include:

- maximum lookup length and scan interval
- popup position mode and media auto-pause

## Building the macOS app

This fork keeps a PyInstaller spec for the macOS bundle:

```bash
pyinstaller meikikai.macos.spec
```

The generated bundle is named `MeikiKai.app`.

For local development, this script builds, optionally signs from `.env`, installs to `/Applications`, and opens the installed app:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit MEIKIKAI_CODESIGN_IDENTITY in .env, or leave it unset for ad-hoc signing.
scripts/build_install_macos.sh
```
